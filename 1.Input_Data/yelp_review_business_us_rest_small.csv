"Row0_Row0","PUFPaY9KxDAcGqfsorJp3Q","Ya85v4eqdd6k9Od8HbQjyA","Mr Hoagie is an institution. Walking in, it does seem like a throwback to 30 years ago, old fashioned menu board, booths out of the 70s, and a large selection of food. Their speciality is the Italian Hoagie, and it is voted the best in the area year after year. I usually order the burger, while the patties are obviously cooked from frozen, all of the other ingredients are very fresh. Overall, its a good alternative to Subway, which is down the road.",0,"5UmKMjUEUNdYWqANhGckJw",0,4,"8/1/12","review",0,"false","false","false","none","false","false","false","false","['Fast Food', 'Restaurants']","false","Mr Hoagie","false","false",1,"false","false",7,"PA","true","false","false","true","false","false","false","false",,"true","Dravosburg",,3.5,"false","false","false","true","false","false","false","average","casual","true","false","false"

But other than that the staff is always pleasant and fast to make your order. Which is always spot on fresh veggies on their hoggies and other food. They also have daily specials and ice cream which is really good. I had a banana split they piled the toppings on.

CONS: The pizza was not good.  Pre-formed crust, NOT fresh dough.  The price of the failure of a pizza WAS NOT CHEAP EITHER.  

I guess the name says it all.  Get the hoagie, pass on the pizza.",0,"5UmKMjUEUNdYWqANhGckJw",0,3,"12/26/15","review",0,"false","false","false","none","false","false","false","false","['Fast Food', 'Restaurants']","false","Mr Hoagie","false","false",1,"false","false",7,"PA","true","false","false","true","false","false","false","false",,"true","Dravosburg",,3.5,"false","false","false","true","false","false","false","average","casual","true","false","false"
